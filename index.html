             <p>
                 The Real Time Pause (RTP) API is an api designed to handle the back end processing for RTP Game Objects and the different kind of states 
                 programmers might want to use with them. Programmers are given the freedom to design their RTP Game Objects to do anything within the bounds 
                 of RTP States. These states act like an update() function with their own init() function, and are meant to be called replacing a Game Object's
                 normal update() function. When initializing an RTP Game Object you insert multiple RTP States and assign each state an id on how to use. In most 
                 scenarios there will be a standard update RTP State to be played when the RTP Game Object is not frozen, and a frozen RTP State to be played when
                 the RTP Game Object is Frozen.
             </p>
             <p>
                 Each RTP Game Object States are meant to be used with multiple states with each state acting very modular. There will be states that only will be queued into
                 action if a certain key is pressed and there will be states that are only queued only if a certain command is passed in from the standard my_game.js update() function. These
                 differences will be identifiable through the use of "id"s that you feed into the constructor when first feeding a state into a RTP Game Object.
                 Should be noted tha these states being queued are action queue based, meaning they get queued, then get played out when the RTP Game Object is no longer in a freeze state.
                 Programmers are free to call each RTP Game Object's freeze state however they feel like in the my_game.js update() function.

         <div class="overflow-hidden content-section" id="Different-Inputs">
            <h2>Different Inputs</h2>
            <p>
               This API is capable of handling 3 different kinds of input: Key Pressed, Key Clicked, and Commands. Each of these inputs are only able to be processed when the 
               RTP Game Object they are refering to is in it's freeze state. In addition to this Key Pressed and Key Clicked must first tell the RTP 
               Game Object that it will be processing these types of information with a process() method. This is due to these types of input possibly taking unnescary memory 
               usage, so are only used when wanted by the developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                RTP Game Object States are each fed an id of which to associate its state to whatever input. Key Clicked are keyboard inputs and are recognized as lowercase letters/numbers
                /symbols ex: "a" or "5". Key Pressed are also keyboard inputs and are recognized as the same as Key Pressed, but with an additional exclamation mark ex: "!a" or "!5".
            </p>
            <p>
                RTP Game Object States recognize commands with actual words, for example: "hero_attack". Commands are proccesed from the mygame.js update() function and are inserted into the 
                action queue when the user calls the insertCommand() function extending from the RTP Game Object. This allows developers to issue commands not only from additional input, but also
                mouse clicks, button clicks, and more.

            Create a new RTP Game Object by extending from the RTPGameObject.js file in the RTP API Folder. You would create this as you would with any other game object you would
            normally create.

        <img src="images/1.JPG" width="50%" style="position:relative; left:50px">

            Create two RTP Game Object States by extending from the RTPGameObjectStates.js file in the RTP API Folder. These two inital states will be known as the update state and the 
            frozen state.

            Now that your RTP Game Object is finished and has all of the desired states loaded into it, go to mygame.js (where your scene is) and initialize the RTP Game Object.

         <p>
            Indicate what type of information you are going to be processing, (I'm processing commands, so I don't need to indicate, but if you are processing KeyClicked or Key Pressed
            you need to indicate that like this)

            If you are processing key clicked and key pressed, your done, the RTP Game Object will automatically process these kinds of input, if you are processing commands like I am
